## Week One
As always, the first week back uni is always very full on and requires a lot of work to be put in to make sure everything is set up correctly for the commencing study block, along with the introduction of the 3 new modules, there is a lot to take in. This week's challenge came from the comp220, with the 6502 assembly coding being brought to the table, this is completely unlike anything I've ever done before, so I feel I'll need to be very well versed to complete the coursework to a good standard. To counteract this challenge, I'll make sure to go over the tutorials that Ed has provided so that I know how the code should be constructed.
