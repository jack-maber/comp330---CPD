# comp330---CPD

## Week One - Beginning 24th September
As always, the first week back uni is always very full on and requires a lot of work to be put in to make sure everything is set up correctly for the commencing study block, along with the introduction of the 3 new modules, there is a lot to take in. This week's challenge came from the comp220, with the 6502 assembly coding being brought to the table, this is completely unlike anything I've ever done before, so I feel I'll need to be very well versed to complete the coursework to a good standard. To counteract this challenge, I'll make sure to go over the tutorials that Ed has provided so that I know how the code should be constructed. 

## Week Two - Beginning 1st October
This week's challenge presented itself in the form of my new 330 game team, as with any new project, the setup of all of the different systems and applications that we'll be using takes a long time as all of the relevant team members and such needed to be added in, so that we can all collaborate and work as one. However, over the summer break I have seem to have forgotten how the majority of the tools, especially GitBash operates, and I had some serious trouble getting functions such as branches to work correctly. As this could cause some serious issues with getting work completed and correctly submitted later down the line, and making sure that everyone can get their individual work contributed to the project. To overcome this issue, I will go back over the relevant documentation to ensure for the software so that I can operate it competently and ensure that the project runs smoothly.  

## Week Three - Beginning 8th October
This week's challenge was the arrival of the first assignment deadline, the comp310 research journal, and once again this assignment was more of a last minute attempt than I'd previously planned for. As I have written about in all of my past CPD reports, I struggle with time management greatly as I underestimate the amount of work that different submissions will take to complete to the standard that I want to achieve, and this study block seems to be no different in that regard as I was so focused on the other, bigger, assignments that I completely forgot about the research journal and it's quality suffered as a consequence. To counteract this issue in the future, I will make better use of my time management techniques such as writing my deadlines out on a calendar, but this study block I'll make sure to move them to a more prominent place so that I'm constantly reminded what is due in, at what time, and how much of my time I should put towards it each week. 

## Week Four - Beginning 15th October
This week's challenge was one that I didn't expect to happen, it stems from the ethics form that is required for the COMP320 dissertation preperation, and as I wanted to get this out of the way as quickly as possible, I thought it would be best to get it done early on, so that I could make any important changes that needed to be addressed further down the line. However, when I came to fill it out, I had a lot of trouble understanding what was required of me, due to my lack of understanding of the more complicated health and safety/ethical practice proccesses. As a result, it took me a while to get it filled in to a level I deemed acceptable to let Rory look over, most of the sections was incorrectly filled in. And thus I had wasted a lot of time, filling in a form that was not satisfactory. To counteract this in future, I will make sure to ask for clarification when it comes to tasks such as this, rather than just struggling on my own, and then wasting my time, as this will save me time that I could put towards other projects. 

## Week Five - Beginning 22nd October
The challenge that presented itself to me this week was from the comp330 peer review session. Unlike many of the other peer reviews that I have taken part in throghout the course, this one took place 2 weeks prior to the hand in, rather than the usual 1 that I am used to. Due to this, my submission was of a lesser quality than I wanted, with only one of my Java applications being ready to show off, meaning the amount of feedback about my submission was greatly reduced. As result of this I'll have less guidance to follow to make sure that I fix all of the issues that are present in my work. To overcome this issue, I'll make sure to check when all of the peer review sessions for the study block are and then factor this in when I undertake working on my prjects, so that they are at a presentable level in time.  
## Week Six- Beginning 29th October
As this week was studio practice, it was spent primarily working on the now decided team game idea. As me and Rich (The other BSc on the team) had been so busy with other assignemnts, we'd had fallen slightly behind on the development of the game, primarily the systems that were being implemeneted by the BA designers. And as the prototype had been created by only one of the BA's over the summer break, it was laready quite developed as it was, so I felt very overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of the systems that had been developed, and due to the lack of comments I was unsure of what did what. So it took me a while to work on any of my own tasks as I didn't want to break the BA's workflow. However, after a while they came to my aid to discuss what I wanted clearing as they could see I was struggling. To overcome this issue in the future, I will ask for clarification on other team mates work so that I can get on with my own tasks, as otherwise I will fall behind on my contributions, which could affect the quality of the final product.
